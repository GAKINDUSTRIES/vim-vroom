*vroom.txt*    Helps you run your Ruby tests

Author: Mike Skalnik <http://mikeskalnik.com>

Run your Ruby tests. Run 1 over and over, then run the whole suite!

                                        *<leader>r*
<leader>r             Run the test file. Saves the one that was run, so next
                      time you hit the key, it runs the same test again, unless
                      you're in different test file.

                                        *<leader>R*
<leader>R             Run the nearest test in the file. Only supported in RSpec.
